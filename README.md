# johnathan-org
Repo for the WordPress theme for johnathan.org

## Requirements

### Local Development

- [Local by Flywheel](//local.getflywheel.com)
- WordPress
- Node.js
- Gulp

Run `npm install` to install all the required `node_modules`. 

## Deployment

Run `gulp dist` in the root directory. This will create a theme folder and corresponding `.zip` to upload. `gulp dist:prod` is only useful for my local environment.
